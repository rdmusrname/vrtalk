Augmented  reality (AR) technology overlays digital  information onto the real world, seamlessly  blending the physical and virtual realms. AR-enabled social  media  applications can enhance real-world social interactions by providing  users with contextual information, interactive experiences, and  shared AR content. This technology has the  potential to transform social gatherings enabling users to  share virtual objects, play AR games and explore their surroundings in  new and engaging ways.
